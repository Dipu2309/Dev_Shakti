/*
->strictfp is the modifier applicable for methods and classes but not for variables.
->Strictfp modifier introduced in 1.2 versions.
->Usually the result of floating point of arithmetic is varing from platform to
  platform , to overcome this problem we should use strictfp modifier.
->If a method declare as the Strictfp then all the floating point calculations in that
  method has to follow IEEE754 standard, So that we will get platform
  independent results.
